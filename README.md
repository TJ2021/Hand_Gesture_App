# SmartHome Gesture Control Application
## About The Project
The SmartHome Gesture Control Application project focuses on creating more accessible and convenient SmartHome devices by allowing control through gesture-based interactions. This project is particularly valuable for enhancing accessibility for the elderly and individuals with disabilities. It has two parts.<br>
#### Part 1: Gesture-Based Mobile Application <br>

The first part of the project involves developing a mobile application using Android Studio that enables users to control SmartHome devices through specific gestures. The application includes features such as:
- A gesture selection interface where users can choose from 17 different gestures (e.g., turning on/off lights, adjusting fan speed, setting thermostat temperatures).
- A practice mode where users can view expert demonstrations of gestures and then record their own attempts using the smartphone's camera.
- The ability to upload recorded gesture videos to a server for further processing.

#### Part 2: Gesture Classification Service<br>

In the second part of the project, a Python-based application is developed to classify the recorded gestures. This involves:
- Using pre-trained machine learning models to classify the specific gestures captured by the mobile application.
- Training and testing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to improve the accuracy of gesture classification.

This project not only provides hands-on experience in mobile application development but also offers exposure to machine learning techniques, particularly in the areas of gesture recognition and classification.
